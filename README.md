### Data on meteorite landings - Tasks

#### Data cleaning

1. Change the names of the variables to follow our naming standards.
2. Split in column GeoLocation into latitude and longitude, the new latitude and longitude columns should be numeric.
3. Replace any missing values in latitude and longitude with zeros.
4. Remove meteorites less than 1000g in weight from the data.
5. Order the data by the year of discovery.
6. Include assertive programming to make sure that variable names are as we expect & Latitude and longitude are valid values.

#### Data Analysis

1. Find the names and years found for the 10 largest meteorites in the data.
2. Find the average mass of meteorites that were recorded falling, vs. those which were just found.
3. Find the number of meteorites in each year, for every year since 2000.

#### Data Visualisation

We want you to use the skills you have learnt this week to visualise your meteorite data - just a simple plot that illustrates part of your cleaned data.
