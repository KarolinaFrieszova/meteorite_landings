# Meteorite landings

## Overview and data source

This is a report using the open meteorites [dataset from NASA](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/meteorite-landings). It is a subset of collected data on meteorites that have fallen to Earth and been found up to the year 2013.

The purpose of this report is to clean and investigate the data using the R language, and answer the following questions:

1. What are the names and years found for the 10 largest meteorites in the data?
2. What is the average mass of meteorites that were recorded falling, vs. those which were just found?
3. What is the number of meteorites in each year, for every year since 2000?
4. Further visual investigation.


## The clean dataset contains seven variables
- id: a unique identifier for the meteorite
- name: the meteorite's name
- mass_g: the mass of the meteorite in grams
- fall: fell - for a meteorite that has been seen falling
        found - meteorite's fall was not observed 
- year: the year the meteorite fell, or the year it was found (depending on the value of fell)
- latitude: the latitude of the meteorite's landing
- longitude: the longitude of the meteorite's landing

## Structure of project and workflow

### The data_cleaning.R file
- read data and change the names of variables to follow naming standards
- split column into 'GeoLocation' latitude and longitude, change the type to numeric
- replace any missing values in latitude and longitude with zeros
- remove meteorites less than 1000g in weight from the data
- order the data by the year of discovery
- assertive programming included ensuring that names of variables as we expect & latitude and longitude observations have valid values
- save cleaned data into the clean_data folder

### The data_analysis.Rmd file
- read clean data in
- find names and years of the ten largest meteorites found
- find the average mass and the total number of meteorites that were recorded falling, vs. those which were just found
- find the number of meteorites in each year, for every year since 2000
- find the average mass of meteorites that were recorded falling, vs. those which were just found
- find the number of meteorites in each year, for every year since 2000
- compare the total number and the average mass of meteorites that were found vs. which were seen falling

### The data_visualisation.Rmd file
- create geographical scatter plot using longitude and latitude 
- the scatter plot displays meteorites by their mass in tons; color-grouped by meteorites which were observed falling vs those that were found

<img src = "images/scatter_plot.png" width = "600" height = "450">

- the second graph is a histogram, displaying the number of meteorites fallen on Earth by year of discovery

## Packages Used

The packages used for data cleaning and analyses `tidyverse` and `janitor`. The package used to verify assumptions about data was `asserts`, and `viridis` color scale was used to make plots pretty and easy to read.
