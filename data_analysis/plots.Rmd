```{r}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
meteorites <- read_csv(here("data/clean_data/meteorites.csv"))
```

1. The names and years found for the 10 largest meteorites in the data.

```{r}
meteorites %>% 
  arrange(desc(mass_g)) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  filter(fall == "Found") %>% 
  select(name, year, mass_g) %>% 
  head(10)
  
```
Alternative way
```{r}
meteorites %>% 
  filter(fall == "Found") %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  slice_max(mass_g, n = 10) %>% 
  select(name, year, mass_g)
```
2. The average mass of meteorites that were recorded falling, vs. those which were just found.

```{r}
meteorites %>% 
  group_by(fall) %>% 
  summarise(average_mass = mean(mass_g),
            count = n())
```

3. The number of meteorites in each year, for every year since 2000.

```{r}
meteorites %>% 
  filter(year >= 2000) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_meteorites = n())
```
